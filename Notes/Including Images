****Understanding Images in HTML****
-->Consider using images that are closer to the size you need instead of
    performing drastic changes to the image's size
        -->The browser will still render the big (or small) image to make it fit your
            size specifications. This may lead to pretty ugly images (blurry, stretched, etc.)
            -->It may also slow down the speed of the page to make time for rendering
        -->Having multiple versions of an image may be more effecient (a jpg and png of the same image, each used for
            different things)

    srcset="imageLink1" 500w, "imageLink2" 690w
        -->We give it the image link w/ the size we want it to be
